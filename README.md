I'm an ex-software developer, now (mostly) doing QA. I still dabble in JS & TS, since I need to keep sharp. Plus, reading code makes me find some extra avenues to look at. I guess I like breaking stuff before users do.

Out of the dayjob, I love following emerging areas such as blockchain as well as machine learning - I'm interested, but it is not something I can contribute to.

Rather, I cannot contribute (much) as of yet. But continuing to explore and follow.
